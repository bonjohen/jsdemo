 Memory Matrix Game (with AI Opponent)
Project Title: NeuroMatch: Memory Matrix Challenge

 Description:
Create a grid-based memory game where a pattern of tiles briefly lights up, then the user has to replicate the pattern. Each level increases the complexity (larger grids, faster flashes). Add a twist by letting users compete against an AI "brain" that learns and predicts player behavior over time.

 Core Features:
Grid of tiles (e.g., 3x3 to 6x6)

Random pattern generation and timed display

Player input tracking and scorekeeping

AI opponent with a “learning curve”:

Early levels: random guess

Later levels: analyze player errors and adjust difficulty or prediction

Local leaderboard

 Bonus Features:
Use Web Storage API or IndexedDB to save progress

Add sound and visual effects (like Simon Says)

Responsive design for mobile play

Add a "challenge mode" where the AI mimics player's past failed patterns

Use TensorFlow.js to create a simple predictive model (if you want to go big)
